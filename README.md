This project involves designing and building a 3RPS parallel manipulator-based ball balancer, utilizing a 3-DOF system with three stepper motors to control the platform's orientation. The system employs inverse kinematic equations to precisely adjust the platform’s angle and keep a ball centered on it. A PID algorithm balances the ball by continuously adjusting the platform's position based on the ball’s error relative to the setpoint. The motors use microstepping for smooth and accurate movement. Additionally, the system can move the ball in various patterns by altering the perceived center of the platform. All components, including the platform, motor mounts, and structural parts, are 3D printed for a lightweight and customizable design. The project integrates a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller,Tmc2208 stepper drivers, and a resistive touch panel to read the ball's position and ensure effective ball balancing
